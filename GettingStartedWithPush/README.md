# [GettingStartedWithPush](./android)

This folder contains the source code for the **Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app** tutorial, using the Mobile Services SDK 2.0. The samples available are for the Android platform and show both the Android Studio and Eclipse IDEs.

The main difference between this code and what you get by completing the [Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-android-get-started-push/) tutorial is that this version contains placeholders for the mobile service url and credentials fields in the **onCreate** method. 

This app may be useful for you if you want to see the completed code, or want code that you can try running.
Note that to run it you must have a mobile service that is set up appropriately.
